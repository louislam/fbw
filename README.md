## Motivation

As Chrome will try to kill a lot of useful extensions by launching Chrome Manifest V3 in 2023, I decided to move my primary browser to Firefox either on PC or Android.

Firefox for Android is surpisingly good

- Bottom navbar
- Addons / Extentsions
- No stupid grouped tabs

However, one of drawbacks of Firefox for Android is that it does not have a bookmark widget. As I mainly used my bookmark toolbar on PC as the root, accessing the bookmarks is required 4 steps on Android (3-dot Menu -> Bookmarks -> PC Bookmarks -> Toolbar Bookmarks), which is not ideal. That's why I want to make this app.
